  		Hello there! Welcome to my page of projects and personality, I hope you enjoy it. I am an aspiring computer programmer in Los Angeles, California and this is my new career. I have been a personal trainer for the last 12 years, and an avid fitness enthusiast for the past 16 years. I love the great outdoors, camping, and being in nature. I have climbed Yosemite's Half Dome 7 times in the last 5 years, camped out in many of our country's national parks from the east coast to the west coast. Aside from hiking and camping, health and fitness have been a driving passion in my life. 
<br>
      I often joke that working out saved my life when I was 20 years old, but it is true. 16+ years later fitness has taken me all over the country and to a few other countries as well. Now I am excited to start a new chapter in my life and contribute to the world in a different way, the web development! Take a look around my page and see some of the things I've been working on. Thanks!
